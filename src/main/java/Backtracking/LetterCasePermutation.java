/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 02/10/2020. Given a string S, we can transform every letter
 * individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string. Return a list of all possible
 * strings we could create.
 *
 * <p>Examples: Input: S = "a1b2" Output: ["a1b2", "a1B2", "A1b2", "A1B2"]
 *
 * <p>Input: S = "3z4" Output: ["3z4", "3Z4"]
 *
 * <p>Input: S = "12345" Output: ["12345"] Note:
 *
 * <p>S will be a string with length at most 12. S will consist only of letters or digits.
 *
 * <p>Solution: O(N x 2 ^ N) Backtrack and generate all possible combinations.
