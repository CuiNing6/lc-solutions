/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 02/10/2022. Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the
 * grid.
 *
 * <p>The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells
 * are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than
 * once.
 *
 * <p>For example, Given board =
 *
 * <p>[ ['A','B','C','E'], ['S','F','C','S'], ['A','D','E','E'] ] word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
 * word = "SEE", -> returns true, word = "ABCB", -> returns false.
