/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 02/21/2021. Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes
 * and return its head.
 *
 * <p>For example, Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
 *
 * <p>Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only
 * nodes itself can be changed.
