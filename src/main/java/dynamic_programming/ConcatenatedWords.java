 * words in the given array.
 *
 * <p>Example: Input:

 *
 * <p>Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
 *
 * <p>Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; "dogcatsdog" can
 * be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; "ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat",
 * "dog" and "cat".
 *
 * <p>Note: The number of elements of the given array will not exceed 10,000 The length sum of
 * elements in the given array will not exceed 600,000. All the input string will only include lower
