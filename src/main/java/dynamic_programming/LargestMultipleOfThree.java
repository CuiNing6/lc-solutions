/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 03/05/2022 Given an integer array of digits, return the largest
 * multiple of three that can be formed by concatenating some of the given digits in any order.
 *
 * <p>Since the answer may not fit in an integer data type, return the answer as a string.
 *
 * <p>If there is no answer return an empty string.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: digits = [8,1,9] Output: "981" Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: digits = [8,6,7,1,0] Output: "8760" Example 3:
 *
 * <p>Input: digits = [1] Output: "" Example 4:
 *
 * <p>Input: digits = [0,0,0,0,0,0] Output: "0"
 *
 * <p>Constraints:
 *
 * <p>1 <= digits.length <= 10^4 0 <= digits[i] <= 9 The returning answer must not contain
 * unnecessary leading zeros.
