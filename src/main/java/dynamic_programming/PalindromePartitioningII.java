/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 03/05/2022. Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the
 * partition is a palindrome.
 *
 * <p>Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
 *
 * <p>For example, given s = "aab", Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be
 * produced using 1 cut.
