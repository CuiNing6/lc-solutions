/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 03/05/2022 Given a string S, count the number of distinct,
 * non-empty subsequences of S .
 *
 * <p>Since the result may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: "abc" Output: 7 Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac",
 * "bc", and "abc". Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: "aba" Output: 6 Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aa"
 * and "aba". Example 3:
 *
 * <p>Input: "aaa" Output: 3 Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".
 *
 * <p>Note:
 *
 * <p>S contains only lowercase letters. 1 <= S.length <= 2000
