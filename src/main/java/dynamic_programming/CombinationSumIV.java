/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 03/05/2022. Given an integer array with all positive numbers
 * and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer
 * target.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <p>nums = [1, 2, 3] target = 4
 *
 * <p>The possible combination ways are: (1, 1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 2) (1, 2, 1) (1, 3) (2, 1, 1) (2, 2)
 * (3, 1)
 *
 * <p>Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
 *
 * <p>Therefore the output is 7. Follow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
 * How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative
 * numbers?
 *
 * <p>Solution: Backtrack and dp
