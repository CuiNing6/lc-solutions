/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 03/05/2022 Given a string S and a string T, count the number of
 * distinct subsequences of S which equals T.
 *
 * <p>A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting
 * some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining
 * characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
 *
 * <p>It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit" Output: 3 Explanation: As shown below, there are 3 ways you
 * can generate "rabbit" from S. (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)
 *
 * <p>rabbbit ^^^^ ^^ rabbbit ^^ ^^^^ rabbbit ^^^ ^^^ Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag" Output: 5 Explanation: As shown below, there are 5 ways you
 * can generate "bag" from S. (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)
 *
 * <p>babgbag ^^ ^ babgbag ^^ ^ babgbag ^ ^^ babgbag ^ ^^ babgbag ^^^
