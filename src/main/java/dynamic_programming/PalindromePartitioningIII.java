/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 03/05/2022 You are given a string s containing lowercase
 * letters and an integer k. You need to :
 *
 * <p>First, change some characters of s to other lowercase English letters. Then divide s into k
 * non-empty disjoint substrings such that each substring is palindrome. Return the minimal number
 * of characters that you need to change to divide the string.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: s = "abc", k = 2 Output: 1 Explanation: You can split the string into "ab" and "c", and
 * change 1 character in "ab" to make it palindrome. Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: s = "aabbc", k = 3 Output: 0 Explanation: You can split the string into "aa", "bb" and
 * "c", all of them are palindrome. Example 3:
 *
 * <p>Input: s = "leetcode", k = 8 Output: 0
 *
 * <p>Constraints:
 *
 * <p>1 <= k <= s.length <= 100. s only contains lowercase English letters.
