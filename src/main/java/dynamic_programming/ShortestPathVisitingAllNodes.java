 *
 * <p>An undirected, connected graph of N nodes (labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1) is given as graph.
 *
 * <p>graph.length = N, and j != i is in the list graph[i] exactly once, if and only if nodes i and
 * j are connected.
 *
 * <p>Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any
 * node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]] Output: 4 Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3] Example
 * 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]] Output: 4 Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
 *
 * <p>Note:
 *
 * <p>1 <= graph.length <= 12 0 <= graph[i].length < graph.length
