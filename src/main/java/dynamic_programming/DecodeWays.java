 * Created by cuining8 on 03/05/2022. A message containing letters from A-Z is being
 * encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
 *
 * <p>'A' -> 1 'B' -> 2 ... 'Z' -> 26 Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the
 * total number of ways to decode it.
 *
 * <p>For example, Given encoded message "12", it could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
 *
 * <p>The number of ways decoding "12" is 2.
