/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 02/18/2022 Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall 'W', an
 * enemy 'E' or empty '0' (the number zero), return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb.
 * The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits
 * the wall since the wall is too strong to be destroyed. Note: You can only put the bomb at an
 * empty cell.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <p>Input: [["0","E","0","0"],["E","0","W","E"],["0","E","0","0"]] Output: 3 Explanation: For the
 * given grid,
 *
 * <p>0 E 0 0 E 0 W E 0 E 0 0
 *
 * <p>Placing a bomb at (1,1) kills 3 enemies.
