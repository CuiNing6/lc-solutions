/**
 * Created by cuining8 on 03/05/2022 Given an integer array arr, in one move you can
 * select a palindromic subarray arr[i], arr[i+1], ..., arr[j] where i <= j, and remove that
 * subarray from the given array. Note that after removing a subarray, the elements on the left and
 * on the right of that subarray move to fill the gap left by the removal.
 *
 * <p>Return the minimum number of moves needed to remove all numbers from the array.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: arr = [1,2] Output: 2 Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: arr = [1,3,4,1,5] Output: 3 Explanation: Remove [4] then remove [1,3,1] then remove
 * [5].
 *
 * <p>Constraints:
 *
 * <p>1 <= arr.length <= 100 1 <= arr[i] <= 20
