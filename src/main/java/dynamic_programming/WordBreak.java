 * Created by cuining8 on 03/05/2022. Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary
 * wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a
 * space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not
 * contain duplicate words.
 *
 * <p>For example, given s = "leetcode", dict = ["leet", "code"].
 *
 * <p>Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
